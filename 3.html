        target="_blank" title="His Profile">Wooseok</a> is kind of rookie actor starting as <strong><u>a tall model</u></strong> like Dongwon. He has very attractive face, especially smile. Then, how about getting closer watching his major work?.</p>
        <br><img src="coding3.jpg" width="600"><p>He has great physical shape, over 190cm tall and small head. His fashion style is always paying attention from many people. I highly recommend his film, named "20th Century Girl".</p>
